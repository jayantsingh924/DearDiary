# DearDiary
DearDiary is a personal blog &amp; notes application designed to store thoughts, learning notes, and daily reflections — enhanced with AI-powered intelligence for writing, understanding, and knowledge retrieval.  This project is built as a long-term skill practice + showcase repository, not just a demo app.
